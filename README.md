## GoChain

A modular educational blockchain implementation in Go. It demonstrates a simple blockchain with blocks, transactions, proof-of-work mining, a mempool, a basic wallet, optional P2P networking (libp2p), and optional persistent storage (BadgerDB).

This codebase is designed for learning and experimentation rather than production use.

### Features
- Blocks and transactions with a Merkle root
- Very simple proof-of-work (target-based) mining
- In-memory blockchain and mempool
- Minimal wallet with ECDSA (P-256) keys, signing and verification
- Integrated P2P networking using libp2p (GossipSub, DHT, mDNS discovery)
- Integrated persistent storage using BadgerDB
- CLI for running a full node, managing wallet, sending transactions, and inspecting chain state

### Architecture overview
- `cmd/gochain`: The main CLI entrypoint that orchestrates and connects all core components to run a full node.
- `pkg/block`: Core types for Block, Header, Transaction, inputs/outputs, and validation helpers
- `pkg/chain`: In-memory blockchain, genesis block creation, adding and validating blocks, difficulty calculation
- `pkg/mempool`: Transaction mempool and selection for block assembly
- `pkg/miner`: Periodic block assembly and proof-of-work hashing loop
- `pkg/wallet`: Key generation, simple address derivation, transaction creation and signing, verification
- `pkg/net`: P2P networking (libp2p GossipSub, DHT-based discovery, MDNS). The `Network` struct implements `libp2p/core/network.Notifiee` and `libp2p/p2p/discovery/mdns.Notifee` for robust peer handling.
- `pkg/storage`: Persistence layer backed by BadgerDB. The `chain.NewChain` now explicitly takes a `*storage.Storage` instance.
- `pkg/consensus`, `pkg/utxo`: Stubs or simple helpers to extend later

Components are designed with dependency injection, allowing for flexible connections and testability.

### Build targets and Go versions
This repository supports two build modes to keep the default toolchain footprint small and allow development on older Go versions:

- Default (no tags):
  - Compiles `pkg/...` packages with Go 1.18+
  - P2P networking and storage are stubbed out
  - CLI requires Go 1.20+; on older Go versions the CLI prints a message and exits

- Full node (recommended): Go 1.20+ with tags `p2p` and `db`
  - Enables libp2p networking and BadgerDB storage, which are now fully integrated into the `cmd/gochain` application.
  - Builds the CLI to run a functional node.

Examples:

```bash
# Run tests for core packages (any supported Go)
go test ./pkg/...

# Build full node (requires Go 1.20+) with P2P and DB enabled
go build -tags='p2p db' ./cmd/gochain

# Run full node (requires Go 1.20+)
./gochain --port 30303 --mining
```

If you are on Go 1.18â€“1.19 and only want to work with the libraries (not the network/storage or CLI), you can build/test `./pkg/...` without tags.

### Install
```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/gochain/gochain
cd gochain

# Optional: use Go 1.20+
# Build full node with networking and storage
go build -tags='p2p db' ./cmd/gochain
```

### Configuration
An example config is provided at `config/config.yaml`. Relevant sections:
- `network`: listen port, bootstrap peers, MDNS, peer limits
- `blockchain`: genesis reward, block time, difficulty adjustment
- `mining`: threads, coinbase address, reward
- `mempool`: max size and minimum fee rate
- `wallet`: key type and passphrase (passphrase unused in current code)
- `storage`: data directory, db type (Badger is supported)
- `api`, `metrics`: placeholders for future expansion

CLI flags in `cmd/gochain` override config values:
- `--config`: path to YAML config
- `--port`: network port (0 for random)
- `--mining`: enable mining
- `--network`: string label (mainnet/testnet/devnet) used for logs only

### CLI usage
```bash
# Run the node (requires Go 1.20+; build with -tags='p2p db' for full features)
./gochain --config ./config/config.yaml --port 0 --mining

# Create a wallet (ephemeral in-memory wallet)
./gochain wallet

# Send a transaction (ephemeral in-memory wallet)
./gochain send --from <address> --to <recipient> --amount 1000 --fee 10

# Query an address balance (ephemeral in-memory wallet)
./gochain balance --address <address>

# Get chain info (height, best block, etc.)
./gochain info
```

Note: The current wallet in the CLI is ephemeral and created in-process. It does not persist keys to disk.

### Testing
```bash
# Run all package tests (recommended)
go test ./...

# Run specific package
go test ./pkg/wallet -v

# Run the main application integration test
go test ./cmd/gochain -v
```

### Recent Updates

This section summarizes recent changes made to the codebase:

*   **Test Suite Fixes:**
    *   Resolved build errors in `cmd/gochain/main.go` related to string literals and `viper` configuration.
    *   Corrected `networkMsg` type usage in `cmd/gochain/main.go` for proper message unmarshaling.
    *   Removed unused import in `cmd/gochain/main.go`.
    *   All existing tests now pass.
*   **Test File Creation:**
    *   Added placeholder test files for `pkg/proto/net` and `proto/net` to ensure all packages have a basic test presence.
*   **Architectural Audit:**
    *   A high-level architectural audit was performed, confirming the project's modular design suitable for educational purposes. It also highlighted areas for future improvement in robustness, scalability, and security, consistent with the existing "Security/audit summary" and "Roadmap ideas".

If building/running with `-tags='p2p db'`, use Go 1.20+ to satisfy dependencies of libp2p, quic-go, and Badger.

### Developer notes
- Build tags:
  - `p2p`: enables the libp2p-backed `pkg/net` implementation
  - `db`: enables the Badger-backed `pkg/storage` implementation
- Without these tags, stub implementations are compiled to avoid pulling in heavy dependencies on older toolchains.
- The blockchain, miner, wallet, and mempool are intentionally simplified for clarity.

### Security/audit summary (high-level)
This codebase is educational and not hardened. Notable findings and recommendations:

- Wallet/crypto
  - Uses ECDSA P-256 from the Go stdlib, not secp256k1 (common in many chains).
  - Address derivation: SHA-256 of uncompressed public key, last 20 bytes. There is no checksum (e.g., no base58check/bech32). Collisions are highly unlikely but usability and safety (typo detection) are weak.
  - Transaction signing format is non-standard (stores public key concatenated with raw r||s). There is no DER encoding or canonical s enforcement; malleability is possible. Recommendation: adopt a canonical signature format and enforce low-s, or switch to an existing, vetted transaction format.
  - The wallet does not persist keys nor encrypt them at rest.

- Transaction model
  - Inputs reference a placeholder 32-byte prev hash with index 0; there is no UTXO or account state validation. Double-spend prevention is not implemented.
  - `CreateTransaction` currently omits balance checks and does not create change outputs. Recommendation: implement a real UTXO/accounting model and enforce balance/fee validation.

- Block validation and consensus
  - Proof-of-work target and difficulty adjustment are extremely simplified. The target representation is not endian- or field-validated, and difficulty retargeting is naive.
  - Timestamp validation is minimal (only monotonic check versus prev block). Recommendation: add drift windows and median-time-past style checks.
  - Merkle root is computed over transaction hashes with simple pair-duplication semantics, which is fine for demo but not optimized.

- Networking (p2p)
  - Relies on libp2p GossipSub and DHT discovery. There is no message validation beyond JSON decoding; no application-level signature checks on network messages.
  - No peer scoring or DoS protection. Recommendation: validate and rate-limit inbound gossip, add lightweight scoring and bans.

- Storage
  - Badger-backed storage is optional; default build stubs it out. There is no compaction strategy beyond a simple GC call nor any recovery routines.

- Concurrency and resource management
  - Mining loop uses simple tick-based generation and early returns on context/cancel signals. There is no backpressure if mempool is large.
  - Some maps are protected with RWMutex; access patterns are straightforward. Nevertheless, there is no shutdown orchestration across subsystems besides best-effort closes.

- Testing
  - Unit tests exist for `block`, `chain`, `wallet`. No tests for miner, mempool, net, or storage. Recommendation: expand test coverage, fuzz transaction encoding/decoding and signature verification.

Given these points, do not use this codebase for production networks or managing real value.

### Roadmap ideas
- Real UTXO set or account-based state with balances and nonces
- Persistent and secure wallet (disk keystore, encryption, HD keys)
- Standardized transaction serialization (e.g., RLP/Protobuf) and signature scheme
- Robust mempool policy and fee estimation
- Stronger PoW difficulty adjustment and consensus rules
- P2P message validation, signature checks, peer scoring
- End-to-end integration tests and property-based tests
- Monitoring/metrics and a JSON-RPC/REST API
