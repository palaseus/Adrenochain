## Goal
Get every package to at least 70% test coverage, starting with the lowest coverage packages first.

## Progress Tracking
### Already Above 70% Coverage âœ…

- [x] pkg/benchmark (88.3% - Already above 70%)
- [x] pkg/proto/net (88.0% - Already above 70%)
- [x] pkg/contracts/engine (87.8% - Already above 70%)
- [x] pkg/defi/amm (85.2% - Already above 70%)

### Need to Reach 70% Coverage ðŸŽ¯
- [x] pkg/contracts/api (0.0% â†’ 87.2% - Already above 70%)
- [x] pkg/sdk (0.0% â†’ 37.1% - Progress made, below 70% target)
- [x] pkg/contracts/storage (0.2% â†’ 19.5% - Progress made, below 70% target)
- [x] pkg/testing (1.1% â†’ 6.3% - Progress made, below 70% target)
- [ ] pkg/contracts/consensus (1.0% â†’ 70%+)
- [ ] pkg/defi/yield (2.8% â†’ 70%+)
- [ ] pkg/contracts/wasm (19.2% â†’ 70%+)
- [ ] pkg/defi/governance (12.0% â†’ 70%+)
- [ ] pkg/defi/lending (35.0% â†’ 70%+)
- [ ] pkg/contracts/evm (43.1% â†’ 70%+)
- [ ] pkg/sync (45.5% â†’ 70%+)
- [ ] pkg/miner (57.4% â†’ 70%+)
- [ ] pkg/storage (58.0% â†’ 70%+)
- [ ] pkg/utxo (59.6% â†’ 70%+)
- [ ] pkg/net (53.5% â†’ 70%+)
- [ ] pkg/logger (66.7% â†’ 70%+)
- [ ] pkg/block (67.9% â†’ 70%+)
- [ ] pkg/security (67.8% â†’ 70%+)
- [ ] pkg/chain (69.3% â†’ 70%+)

## Next Steps
1. Start with `pkg/contracts/api` (0.0% coverage) - Lowest priority
2. Create comprehensive test suite for each package
3. Move to next lowest coverage package in order
4. Continue until all packages reach 70%+
5. Focus on packages closest to 70% first for quick wins
