- **Static Analysis**: Identifies potential race conditions
- **High Concurrency**: Tests under high concurrency loads

#### Memory Leak Detection
- **Allocation Tracking**: Monitors memory allocation patterns
- **Garbage Collection**: Tests garbage collection efficiency
- **Extended Testing**: Long-running tests for memory leak detection

### Running Security Validation

#### Using the Script
```bash
./scripts/run_security_validation.sh
```

#### Manual Execution
```bash
cd cmd/security
go build -o security .
./security
```

### Security Results

The framework generates comprehensive security reports including:

- **Test Status**: PASS, FAIL, or WARNING for each test
- **Issue Categorization**: Critical issues, warnings, and total issues
- **Package Security**: Security status breakdown by package
- **Test Type Analysis**: Security analysis by test type
